# Question 1

## Problem Statement
Load an image you took using your mobile camera. Look up kernel operations and apply those programmatically on your image to perform the following actions:
 * increase brightness by 20%
 * increase contrast by 50%
 * perform a gamma correction using gamma value of 1.2
 * Invert the image ie., newvalue = 255 â€“ oldvalue 
 * detect the edges in the image. 
Create a brief report with these images and the code snippets of what you did.

### Output Required
The octave code, a report containing modified images and the operations that achieved those modifications. Your report should mention the sources you used to pick up the kernels for achieving those image modifications.

### Application
Image manipulation is important for not only the entertainment industry but also for computer vision and automated operations in a plant. Such codes need to be fast and reliable if they should be applied on a live video.

## Solution

**Language Used:** `octave`

**Outputs:** [Brightened](Brightened.jpg), [Contrast](Contrast.jpg), [Corrected](Corrected.jpg), [Inverted](Inverted.jpg), [Detected](Detected.jpg)
