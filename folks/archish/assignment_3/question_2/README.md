# Question 2

## Problem Statement

There are a number of natural phenomena that can be described using a fraction of evolution as
a function of time. If one were to quantify the evolution and plot, it could look like the following
image. The scatter is part of the uncertainty in experimental measurements. The blue line shows a
model that is fit over this data.

**Assignment Task:**
* Using a combination of appropriate functions and random noise, generate a plot that looks like this.
* Use the data from the above plot to fit a function and identify the time at which the growth rate is most rapid.


### Output Required
The python code, PDF containing the images or screenshots the plots, model used,
brief description on how you identified the time for maximum growth and a numerical value of that time for the dataset you generated.

### Application
In natural phenomena such as growth of bacteria in a petridish, percolation of a fluid seeping into a porous body, spread of an infectious disease in a population and accumulation of damage in a dynamic load bearing structural member of a machine, measurements of the evolution could appear like in this plot. One would like to use a good physically based model to predict the time for maximum growth rate and also the time when the saturation has taken place within an errorbar.
