# Question 6

## Problem Statement
Consider a transformation by which a function is transformed to another function where m and c are slope and intercept of the original curve at different points on the curve represented by y as function of x. The envelope of lines of slope m drawn at each value of c has the same shape as that of the curve drawn using the points (x,y). This is illustrated a parabola as shown in the figures below. Write a program that converts a function given as y(x) to the new form either graphically or analytically. Make sure your process works even when the function y(x) is changed to any other smooth and well behaved function.
