# Question 1

## Problem Statement
Generate 10 random numbers y i between -1 and +1. Use these as points (x_i , y_i ) where x_i =i and show them as a scatter plot. Fit a higher order polynomial over these points to generate a pattern of how a random noise would look like. Sample the polynomial to generate about 100 points in the interval x_1 to x_10 . Superpose a plot of this data along with original points (x_i , y_i ). Identify the peaks (location and height) programmatically. Print them out and confirm those with the plot.
