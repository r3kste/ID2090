# Assignment 4

## Question 1

This assignment checks for your skills in github, latex and also showcases your interest in a
scientific topic of your choice. Marks indicated are equal for everyone in the team for the team
activity. For individual tasks, they are given to those students who completed that task. The way it
works is as follows.

* Each team can identify one person who can take lead in starting the activity. The team lead will create a fork of the repository https://github.com/gphanikumar/git-latex-jun2021 in their personal github account.
* Each member of the team including the team lead will create a file named after their roll number, eg., me20b001.tex. This file contains a section titled after the name and roll number of the student, an equation that the student likes, a paragraph that describes each term of that equation, what it means and its importance. The section should include a reference to the equation number while talking about it. The section should also include a citation from where the equation is taken from. Each member should also get hold of an image (about 200 pix wide) to go along with their text. Name that image after your roll number. Don’t forget to refer to that image by figure number in the text. The bibliographic information about the source of the equation and image should be placed in a bib file common for each team (say, team-1.bib). In case a copy-paste is detected, the timestamp of the file on github will determine who owns the text.
* Each member of a team will create a branch for the forked repo, add their tex file, bib file and the image file under their team folder and send pull request to their lead. The team lead will merge all the files in the forked repo. Watch out that there is only one bib file for the whole team.
* Team should get together on google meet once to get this working before submission. A screenshot of the google meet can be included in their forked repo as proof. Team will ensure the file team-1.tex will compile to include all their contributions along with references.
 * Team lead will place entries to include the individual files of the team into a master tex file
named after the team (say team-1.tex) and make sure it compiles to produce a document. Assume that you can use “article” for document class, 12 pt, a4 paper, 1 inch margin on all sides of the paper. The final PDF of the team will have as many sections as the number of students in the team.
 * Team lead will inform the TA about their forked repo to have a look and evaluate by first looking at the final PDF and then the individual contributions, time stamps of their entry into github, etc.,
