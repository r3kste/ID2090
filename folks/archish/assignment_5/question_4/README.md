# Question 4

## Problem Statement
A rectangular region of width A and breadth B needs to be segmented into smaller portions for certain calculation. Using random number generation split up the region into N triangles that are numbered and colored different from its neighbors. Your code should take the size A\*B and the number of triangles N as input. For each triangle, generate a list of its vertices. Generate a list of edges shared by the triangles.

### Output Required
The sagemath code, a plot of domain showing the triangulation, output showing the lists asked for.

### Application
Discretization of domain into smaller regions of certain shape is part of performing calculations
to solve partial differential equations. 

**Hint:** Delauney & Voronoi

## Solution

**Language Used:** `sagemath`

**Output:** [17 Triangles](17-Triangulation.png), [20 Triangles](20-Triangulation.png)
