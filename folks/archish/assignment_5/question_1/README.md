# Question 2

## Problem Statement
Consider a set A containing the range of integers between 1 and 225. What is the maximum number of elements in a set B, a subset of A such that the difference between any pair of elements is not a perfect square.

### Output Required
The sagemath code, list of elements of B and the size of the list B.

### Application
Graphs come of use in asserting relations between nodes and then querying on them.

## Solution

**Language Used:** `sagemath`
