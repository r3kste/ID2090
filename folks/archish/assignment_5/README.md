# Assignment 5

## [Question 1](question_1)

Consider a set A containing the range of integers between 1 and 225. What is the maximum number of elements in a set B, a subset of A such that the difference between any pair of elements is not a perfect square.

## [Question 2](question_2)

Draw a circle with a radius r and (p,0) as origin. Rotate this circle about the origin by angles given by 2πj/14 where 0 ≤ j ≤ 14. Color each of these circles differently. Vary r and p between 1 and 3. Create a map of patterns in the parametric space of r and p.

## [Question 3](question_3)

Determine the (complex) roots of a polynomial such as f(x) = x 6 -5\*x+1. Plot the roots as points in the complex plane and identify the circle within which all the roots like. Change the coefficients and see if you can generalize the solution.

## [Question 4](question_4)

A rectangular region of width A and breadth B needs to be segmented into smaller portions for certain calculation. Using random number generation split up the region into N triangles that are numbered and colored different from its neighbors. Your code should take the size A\*B and the number of triangles N as input. For each triangle, generate a list of its vertices. Generate a list of edges shared by the triangles.
