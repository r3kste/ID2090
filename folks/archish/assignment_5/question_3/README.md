# Question 3

## Problem Statement
Determine the (complex) roots of a polynomial such as f(x) = x 6 -5\*x+1. Plot the roots as points in the complex plane and identify the circle within which all the roots like. Change the coefficients and see if you can generalize the solution.

### Output Required
The sagemath code, a plot of roots as points in the complex plane.

### Application
This concept applies to the eigen values of a matrix and helps analyse several concepts in
continuum mechanics.
