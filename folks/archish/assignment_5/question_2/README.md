# Question 2

## Problem Statement
Draw a circle with a radius r and (p,0) as origin. Rotate this circle about the origin by angles given by 2πj/14 where 0 ≤ j ≤ 14. Color each of these circles differently. Vary r and p between 1 and 3. Create a map of patterns in the parametric space of r and p.

### Output Required
The sagemath code, a 2D pallet of patterns mapped against the values of r and p.

### Application
Rotations of objects in space and their tragectories allow for evaluation of possible overlap with surrounding structure. Analysis of such overlaps help in path planning of moving objects.
